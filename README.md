# Visualizing Unpaid Labor

[Makeover Monday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a weekly development and learning community dedicated to creating better and more informative data visualizations. Each week, a new data set is released along with the original visualization. The idea is to get a lot of people together creating their own unique spin on visualizing the data. At the end of the week, the blog authors pick a community submission to "makeover" and provide feedback.
